![Bookstore](https://github.com/Koco90/Bookstore_database/blob/main/pexels-pixabay-256431.jpg)

### Project Description
This is a program that can be used by a bookstore clerk. 
It is essentially a book database in which you can add, update, delete, view all or search for books.

### How does it work?
You will need to import the following:
* os
* sqlite3

When you run the program, it should be self explanatory as it works through a main menu.
The program is able to deal with most incorrect entries.
Some entries of books are already included. This can be altered easily by changing the code.

### Who could use this project?
A bookstore clerk could use this code.
Some who is looking to build a similar database could use this as a foundation.

### What is the goal of this project?
To easily manage a bookstore database.
